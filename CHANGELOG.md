## [Next release]

### ✨ Added
- Example page for the `StratifiedPTDMeanEstimator`

### 🔄 Changed
- Refactored `glide.core.simulated_datasets` into dedicated `glide.simulators` module with separate files for each generator function
- Replaced "semi-supervised" with "prediction-powered" everywhere in the docs and code
- Rewrote CLT and Bootstrap confidence intervals to cache lower/upper bounds for a given confidence level

### 🐛 Fixed
- Handling of NaN values in `StratifiedClassicalMeanEstimator`
